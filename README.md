# Project Najva

The project aims to become the go to web client for XMPP, and spread light of security and freedom by making xmpp more accessible and actually usable in everyday life.

The project will remain open source and the hope is that the fellow comrade xmpp providers will also host this client alongside the numerous free servers or maybe paid ones🤷‍♂️.

All this until the direly needed job takes the dev guy away, then... who knows.... maybe something miraculous will happen and the project will survive to live on a long fulfilling life... Or may dear Najva rest in peace🪦
